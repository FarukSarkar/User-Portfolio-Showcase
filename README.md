# User Portfolio Showcase

This is a simple web application that allows users to enter any GitHub username and view that user's repositories. The repositories are displayed with details like the repository name, description, programming languages used, number of stars and forks, and last updated date. This project demonstrates how to use the GitHub API to fetch data and display it in a clean, responsive UI.
